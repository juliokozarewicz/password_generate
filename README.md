# Secure Password Generator API

This project is a secure and efficient password generator API built using modern technologies and best practices. It leverages TypeScript, Node.js, and Express for the backend, with a microservices architecture and an API Gateway (NGINX) to manage traffic efficiently. The API is designed with a focus on security, scalability, and maintainability, and includes robust features like password strength validation and rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks.

Key Features:
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed development environment for better code quality and maintainability.
- **API Gateway (NGINX)**: Manages traffic routing, load balancing, and serves as a reverse proxy for microservices.
- **Microservices**: Modular architecture that breaks the application into small, independently deployable services.
- **Node.js & Express**: Lightweight backend powered by Node.js and Express for fast and scalable performance.
- **TypeORM**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for interacting with the database, providing a clean and structured way to manage data.
- **Logs**: Integrated logging system to monitor application behavior, using tools like Winston or Pino for structured logging.
- **Error Handler**: Global error handling middleware to catch and respond to errors in a consistent and standardized manner.
- **Documentation (Swagger & Redocly)**: API documentation powered by Swagger for easy integration and Redocly for a polished, user-friendly interface.
- **Rate Limiter (DDOS Protection)**: Integrated rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks and excessive request load, improving security and stability.
- **Inputs Validation (Zod & Lodash)**: Using Zod for schema-based validation and Lodash for utility functions to enhance data integrity and processing.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application to ensure consistency across different environments and simplify deployment.
- **Internationalization (Server-Side Translation)**: Built-in support for server-side translation, allowing the API to serve responses in multiple languages based on the userâ€™s preferences.

This project provides a robust and secure foundation for generating passwords with the ability to scale and adapt to future requirements. The combination of security mechanisms, effective logging, and comprehensive documentation ensures that the API is reliable and user-friendly for developers and end-users alike.
